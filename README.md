download a release, unzip it, and go to chrome://extensions/. Turn on dev mode on the top right, and click "load unpacked". Select "thing" (I name files weirdly sorry) and make sure you have the Grammarly premium extension installed. now, you should be able to hover over the premium suggestion and it should reveal it to you for free, but you can't click it.


Sorry that its not on the chrome web store they did not like it :l
